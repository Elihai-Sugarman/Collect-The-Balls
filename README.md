Welcome to Collect The Balls!

In this game, you can move your player on the board by clicking on one of the neighbour cells, or by using the keyboard (up, down, left, right).
You can use the passage tunnels on the sides, but you need to move fast and catch all the balls on the board. The longer you'll wait, the more balls you'll have to run after.
And careful, don't run into a sticky cell if you can help it...
